9th Mar - See meeting minutes. Had a general discusssion around the topics to examine for the project and began to focus more on the game space as there is plenty of info online in 
	this area. Considered different games (mostly grid based games to keep this relatively simple) such as chess, minesweeper, checkers, etc. Also looked at Car racing 
	(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r428O_CMcpI). Aaron noted that a fair few of the openAI atari environments have an RGB image as their state space, so we decided against those. 
	We have initially settled on the game snake and discussed the possible algorithms we could look at and have sent an email looking for some feedback on our ideas. We will 
	schedule another meeting when we receive a response to discuss the next steps

15th Mar - See meeting minutes. Reached a conclusion on the algorithms we would examine and the snake environment we would build upon (https://pythonspot.com/snake-ai-in-pygame/). 
	The algorithms we are going to investigate are A* (Owen Burke), Hamiltonian solvers (Conor Heffernan), Genetic algorithms (Conor McNally, Thomas Kelly) and 
	Deep Q-learning (Aaron Duggan). Conor McNally set up a shared overleaf report for us to work on and Thomas Kelly volunteered to write up the general intro/conclusion parts of the
	report, just to get things going while we implement the algorithms. Next thing to do is get everyone set up with the environment and start implementing the algorithms.


2nd April - Initial version of algorithms are implmented, but we still need to make alterations to the environment (i.e adding new fruit etc), 
	and as a result we will need to update these algorithms to reflect these changes
